\chapter{Introduction}
The MARS working group provides a Multi-agent simulation framework for model developers to work with. To reduce the technical barrier of entry, a web interface is provided. This  so called Websuite allows the user to take all necessary steps, to interact with the simulation system.\\
To make the Websuite better maintainable and scalable, it has been transfered to a micro-service architecture. This work covers the extraction and redesign of the front-end, which will be called WebUI. The WebUI's responsibilities are to serve the graphical user-interface and communicate with the back-end services.


\section{Motivation}
The Websuite in its old form was written by different people without a shared vision nor commonly shared user-guidance or design in mind. This meant that components behaved very different from one another, which resulted in a bad overall user-experience.\\
The goal of this work is to redesign the front-end to follow a clear and consistent work-flow with a unified user-interface. This is achieved by elaborating the different use-cases for the system and implementing requirements based on these use-cases.
