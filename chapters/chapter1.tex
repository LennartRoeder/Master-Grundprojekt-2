\chapter{Introduction}
The MARS working group provides a Multi-agent simulation framework for model developers to work with. To reduce the technical barrier of entry, a web interface is provided. This  so called Websuite allows the user to take all necessary steps, to interact with the simulation system.\\
To make the Websuite better maintainable and scalable, it has been transfered to a micro-service architecture. This work covers the extraction and redesign of the front-end, which will be called WebUI. The WebUI's responsibilities are to serve the graphical user-interface and communicate with the back-end services.
