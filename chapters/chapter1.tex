\chapter{Introduction}
The MARS working group provides a Multi-agent simulation framework for model developers to work with. To reduce the technical barrier of entry, a web interface is provided. This  so called Websuite allows the user to take all necessary steps, to interact with the simulation system.\\
To make the Websuite better maintainable and scalable, it has been transfered to a micro-service architecture. This work focuses on the transition of the monolithic application to a stand-alone front-end container, called WebUI. The WebUI's responsibility is to serve the graphical user-interface.
